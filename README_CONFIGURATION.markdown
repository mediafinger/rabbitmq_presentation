# RabbitMQ

An introduction to create a mutual understanding about **publishing**, **routing** and **consuming** messages with RabbitMQ and the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP).

AMQP was defined and implemented for the first time over ten years ago. Since then it expanded beyond the finance and banking sector it originated in, into many different industries.

RabbitMQ is a high performance **message broker** based on AMQP. Using the broker architecture it can be scaled independently. Applications use it over lightweight client libraries.

### Decoupling services

In our current service oriented architecture, the system triggering an event (or receiving it from an external service), would manage large parts of the logic needed to react to this event. It would make calls to different services and endpoints to create or update records. To do this in a resilient way, we setup background workers in each application that handle asynchronous processing and retries.

Using a message bus you would usually inform other systems about events and those implement the logic if and how to react.

Decoupling services by introducing an asynchronous messaging system between them, allows to change and scale systems independently.

### Handling high volumes of messages

The message broker distributes messages and can in this process throttle the load towards the message receiving systems.

This can reduce failure rate in peak times and at the same time speed up the systems sending messages, as they are no longer blocked by waiting for an answer of a potentially slow system. This can go as far as decoupling your database writes.

### Broadcasting and replicating messages

The message broker can inform multiple systems about changes and events. This allows to add new functionality seamlessly.

It can replicate data and events to data centers in other regions to achieve high availability. This raises the guarantees of message delivery and better performing front end apps for customers around the globe.

### Features and benefits

* Open source, maintained by Pivotal Software Inc
* written in Erlang
* lightweight, but powerful
* very flexible in controlling trade-offs between reliable message throughput and performance
* plugins to extend core-functionality
* layers of security
* clients libraries for most modern languages exist
* background workers are a subset of messaging systems and come included

### Alternative Protocols

RabbitMQ features a full implementation of AMQP 0.9.1 as well as several custom additions over it.

While this how-to focuses on RabbitMQ's AMQP implementation only, RabbitMQ also features implementations of a few other messaging protocols that can be used for special use cases.

* MQTT a lightweight protocol often used to implement pub-sub patterns with high latency mobile devices
* STOMP a text-based protocol creates compatibility with ApacheMQ
* statelessd / Hare for high velocity fire and forget messaging

## Publishing messages

When publishing messages, RabbitMQ offers multiple methods to pick from. Each choice is a **trade-off between speed and security** that messages have really been delivered. All options can be combined to find the sweet spot for the type of messages being send on a specific queue.

This list skips the Transaction pattern RabbitMQ implements (AMQP TX), as the alternatives offer more lightweight and less complex methods to achieve the same goals.

### Fastest, no guarantees

* fire and forget, messages might get lost, without informing the publisher about it
* set `mandatory=true` to get messages returned when they are not routable, returned messages have to be handled
* set `immediate=true` to get messages returned when no queue is ready to consume them, returned messages have to be handled

### Publisher confirmation®

* lightweight and quick way to ensure a message can be routed and the **broker** has processed it
* an unroutable _mandatory_ or an undeliverable _immediate_ message is confirmed right after the `basic.return`
* a _transient_ message is confirmed the moment it is _enqueued_
* a _persistent_ message is confirmed when it is _persisted_ to disk
* confirmation is send asynchronously
* the publisher should make no assumptions about the exact time a message is confirmed
* if the broker runs into issues, it will `basic.nack` messages

### High availability (HA) queues

* a cluster is mandatory to use HA queues
* messages will be handled on all nodes of the cluster that handle the HA queue
* if a node goes down, the message does still exist on the other nodes
* this can replace slow persistence to disk in many cases
* once a message is consumed from any node in the cluster, all copies will be removed
* clusters can be connected in different ways, this is a topic of its own

### Persisted, slowest but most secure

* set `delivery-mode=2` to persist every message before queueing it
* messages will survive restarts of the whole system
* define the queues and the exchanges as `durable`
* when the system goes down, messages that have not been persisted yet, might still get lost
* I/O performance of the system must be high, to not slow message handling down
* use _lazy queues_ when you expect extremely long queues, or suffer from unpredictable performance
* _lazy queues_® are slower, as they remove the messages from RAM

---

## Consuming messages

When consuming messages, RabbitMQ offers multiple methods to pick from. Each choice is a **trade-off between speed and security** that messages have really been consumed.

This list skips the Transaction pattern RabbitMQ implements (AMQP TX), as the alternatives offer more lightweight and less complex methods to achieve the same goals.

It also skips the `get` pattern, as the performance is worse compared to `consuming` messages. At the same time it does not offer benefits over the available alternatives.

### Fastest, no guarantees

* messages are consumed, but `no_ack` is sent
* no guarantee if a message was delivered or successfully processed
* the consumer might be overloaded and crash with an unknown number of buffered messages

### Quality of Service (QoS) level, ack after prefetch count reached

* set a QoS level, to determine how many messages to prefetch, before sending an `ack`
* consumer counts the number of messages before sending an `ack` when the `prefetch_count` was reached
* when connection dies, all messages of the current batch are re-queued
* reject a batch of `multiple` messages by sending a `basic.nack`®, they will be re-queued
* this can result in messages being send multiple times
* lightweight system that allows for high throughput rates
* needs benchmarking to find the perfect prefect_count per queue

### Delivery confirmation, (manual) ack, slowest but most secure

* the default setting is to send an automatic `ack` after a message was sent
* change it to `manual_ack=true` to send the `ack` after processing the message
* send a `basic.nack` or `basic.reject` to reject and delete a message
* reject a message with `requeue=true` to redeliver it

## Examples

Real world use cases and some thoughts about which **publishing** and which **consumption methods** to chose.

### Logging / Metrics

Typical fire and forget use case. Losing some of the many millions of messages won't affect the system, but slow message handling would. Choose the _fastest publishing and consumption methods_ without guarantees.

### SMS-TAN / Email notifications

_Publishing confirmation_ can be set to ensure the message has been routed. In case you are sending many notifications per client per day, this might be the only guarantee you opt in to. You expect the delivery to succeed in almost all cases. And you are aware that there will never be a guarantee that a recipient will really receive an email is his inbox or a text message on this phone.

If you need the guarantee that your SMS or email system is processing the messages, setting a _QoS level_ and receiving an `ack` after multiple messages have been processed is a reasonable choice.

If it's not about pure notifications, but information that has to reach the customer, _dead-letter queues_ should be used to handle failures.

### Data changes

A customer changes his personal data on one system and it has to inform other application about it. In this case the choice of methods depends heavily on how important it is for the other applications to have the latest data.

An invoicing tool that sends out emails, might be ok with eventual consistency of the real world address of the customer.

The service informing about the data change could send messages with _publishing confirmation_ and no further guarantees.

#### Data changes

However you will need a strategy to create consistency eventually. Maybe a job that sends messages every night for each customer whose data changed in the last 24h. As you might have less system load at night, using a _QoS level_ might give you the guarantees you need.

Nevertheless the same tool might expect to always be immediately informed about changes in the payment data or email address. In this case you would need to pick more secure messaging strategies like a _HA queue_ and _manual `ack`_ after message delivery.

### Money transfers

When a redundant cluster is available, using _HA queues_ with _delivery confirmation_ and _dead-letter exchanges_ is a secure choice.

As money transfers need all possible guarantees, you will want to add _persistence of messages to disk_ into the mix. This ensures all messages can be recovered even in the case of catastrophic failure.

## Broker & Exchange routing

* to connect publishers and consumers at least one exchange has to be declared
* exchange names consist of letters, digits, hyphen, underscore, period, or colon `[A-Za-z0-9-_.:]`
* a default _direct exchange_ with the name `''` (empty string) exists
* RabbitMQ allows to bind exchanges to exchanges for extra flexibility, which comes with extra complexity and overhead, you most probably won't need this feature

### Queues

* after declaring an exchange, `bind` at least one queue to it
* queue names consist of letters, digits, hyphen, underscore, period, or colon `[A-Za-z0-9-_.:]`
* the empty string `''` is a valid queue name
* has the queue name been omitted on declaration, a new queue with a generated unique name will be created
* queues can be declared to be `exclusive` and will be deleted when the connection closes
* to enhance performance, multiple **consumers** can subscribe to a queue, messages are then distributed in a _round robin_ way, so that each consumer will process a part of all messages, which helps to keep queues short


### Direct exchanges

* match the `routing_key` of messages to the **binding key** of queues
* the string is matched for equality, no pattern matching
* `[A-Za-z0-9-_.:]` are the only valid characters for `routing_keys` (TODO: validate this!)
* multiple queues can be bound to the same `routing_key`
* a queue can be bound to multiple `routing_keys`
* every queue will receive all messages matching the **binding key**
* _direct exchanges_ are a good choice for routing reply messages

### Fanout exchanges

* all messages published are delivered to all queues bound to the exchange
* no routing keys are necessary
* faster routing, as not matching has to be performed
* all applications consuming from a _fanout exchange_ need to handle all kinds of messages delivered through it

### Topic exchanges

* `routing.keys` are dot separated, queues define a **binding key**
* pattern matching is used to route messages to queues
* an asterisk `*` matches any characters up to the next dot `.`
* the pound `#` matches any characters including dots `.`
* `[A-Za-z0-9]` are the only valid characters besides the dot `.`
* emulate _direct exchange_ queues by binding to the exact `routing.key`
* emulate _fanout exchange_ queues by binding to any routing.key through `#`
* _topic exchanges_ are very flexible and a good future-proof choice

### Headers exchanges

* inspects the `headers` hash of the message `properties` to route the message
* no routing keys are necessary
* `bind` accepts an array of `key-value` pairs as parameter
* the `x-match` argument determines if `any` key-value pair has to be included in the properties headers, or if `all` have to match
* additional key-value pairs included in the headers property do not influence the routing


### Other exchanges

RabbitMQ provides other types of exchanges through plugins to enable special use cases. For example the _consistent-hashing_® exchange to load-balance the number of messages sent to queues in a cluster.


### Handling failure

TODO:

* retries and final failure
* dead-letter boxes and poisonous messages https://derickbailey.com/2016/03/28/dealing-with-dead-letters-and-poison-messages-in-rabbitmq/

#### Alternate exchanges

When a published message can not be routed by the broker.

* define an `alternate-exchange` to route the message to, when the actual is unable to route it
* a `mandatory=true` message would be re-routed instead of being returned
* publishers won't have to handle returned messages
* declare an exchange and `bind` at least one queue to it
* messages stay in the `alternate-exchange` queue(s) for inspection, unless a consumer is defined

#### Dead-letter exchanges®

When a queued message expires or is rejected by the consumer.

* define an `x-dead-letter-exchange` when declaring the queue
* messages stay in the dead-letter queue for inspection, unless it they expire or handled by a consumer
* handling processing failure with dead-letter queues is simpler and safer than burdening the consumer client with it
* having only messages of one type in the queue makes error handling easier
* the message headers will be changed
* could be combined with a delayed retry strategy: https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange

## Routing examples

In a **fanout exchange** all queues will receive all messages. This burdens the consumers of this queues with handling differnt kind of messages.

In a **direct exchange** every queue bound to an exact `routing_key` of a message, will receive this message. When multiple queues are bound to the same `routing_key` the message will be routed to all of these queues. A message will only be removed from the system, when it was delivered in all bound queues.

A **headers exchange** allows for very flexible routing. It matches `key-value` pairs of the `headers` `property` of messages.

### Topic exchange

Very flexible routing can be implemented through the **topic exchange.** Pattern matching allows queues to handle all, some or only very specific messages. This way it is capable to emulate the _direct_ and the _fanout exchange_.

The parts of **routing keys** are separated by dots `.`

The **binding keys** implement pattern matching by including asterisk `*` or pound `#` characters.

### Routing keys schema

Let's assume we have a service that connects tech communities all over the world. Our routing keys have usually three parts:  
a _city_, a _topic_ and a _category_:

| City      | Topic   | Category |
|:----------|:--------|:---------|
| barcelona | android | event    |
| berlin    | elixir  | job      |
| london    | ruby    | news     |
| madrid    | testing | question |
| vancouver | wwcode  | tutorial |

### Routing keys examples

The above list would allow for `routing.keys` like the following:

* `barcelona.ruby.event`
* `barcelona.ruby.job`
* `barcelona.testing.job`
* `berlin.testing.job`
* `vancouver.wwcode.event`

### Binding queues to the topic exchange

Queues are bound to the exchange by a _binding key_ which is a pattern or the exact string.

Messages can be delivered to multiple queues that can have one or more consumers each.

### Binding examples

| Binding key            | Explanation                                |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| `barcelona.#`          | every message for Barcelona                |
| `barcelona.*.event`    | matches all events in Barcelona            |
| `barcelona.ruby.*`     | matches everything about Ruby in Barcelona |
| `barcelona.ruby.event` | matches the exact `routing.key`            |
| `*.ruby.*`             | matches everything about Ruby everywhere   |
| `#.job`                | matches all messages about Jobs            |
| `#`                    | all messages                               |

## Messages

When discussing publishing, routing and consumption of messages, parameters like the routing key have been mentioned. The _routing information and arguments_, are part of the **method frame.** The **content header frame** contains the _size and the properties_ of a message. The _payload_ is contained in the **body frame.**

Together the three frames represent a full AMQP message.

### Message properties

| Property           | Type      | Used by     | Use case                                                               |
|:-------------------|:----------|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app_id`           | String    | Application | use it to describe the publisher                                       |
| `content-encoding` | String    | Application | in case compression is used `gzip`, `zlib` or encoded content `Base64` |
| `content-type`     | String    | Application | mime-type of the message body `application/json`                       |
| `message_id`       | String    | Application | typically a UUID                                                       |
| `timestamp`        | timestamp | Application | Unix epoch timestamp in seconds, use `Time.now.utc.to_i`               |
| `type`             | String    | Application | use it to describe message or payload                                  |

### Properties that (can) influence routing

| Property         | Type   | Used by      | Use case                                                                  |
|:-----------------|:-------|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `correlation_id` | String | Application  | typically used to reference a request or message when sending a response  |
| `delivery-mode`  | 1 or 2 | RabbitMQ     | 1 = keep message in memory, 2 = persist to disk                           |
| `expiration`     | String | RabbitMQ     | one way to set an expiration date, a timestamp in seconds but as String   |
| `headers`        | Hash   | Rabbit & App | key-value table to store any additional metadata, can be used for routing |
| `reply_to`       | String | RabbitMQ     | commonly used to name a callback queue                                    |

### Advanced Properties

| Property   | Type   | Used by  | Use case                                                         |
|:-----------|:-------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `priority` | 0..9   | RabbitMQ | 0 has highest priority, usage is a bit tricky                    |
| `user_id`  | String | RabbitMQ | identify message was sent by logged-in user, don't manipulate it |

### Payload

They payload is contained in the **body frame.** When the size of the payload exceeds the maximum size of a message frame, it will be split over multiple **body frames**. The form of the payload is described by the `content-type` and `content-encoding` _header properties_.

Consumers clients should decode and deserialize the message body, to make it easier for the application to handle messages.

## Code Examples

To try those examples you'll need a running RabbitMQ broker. The examples are written in Ruby and `require "bunny"`. You can always use **RabbitMQ's management UI** to check the status of your broker and queues:

http://localhost:15672/ (user: guest, password: guest)

Instead of using bunny directly, you could chose to implement a **framework** like:

* hutch: https://github.com/gocardless/hutch
* sneakers: https://github.com/jondot/sneakers/wiki

But those are not covered in here.

### Setting up a topic exchange and binding queues to it

The following code snippets will:

* open a **connection** and create a **channel** for the _publisher_
* declare a **topic exchange** and a queue
* bind the **queue** to the topic exchange
* publish **messages** to the topic exchange
* open a **connection** and create a **channel** for the _consumer_
* create a consumer for the **queue**
* bind the consumer to the **queue**

#### Open connection and create channel for publisher

```ruby
url = "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2F"

connection = Bunny.new(url)
connection.start

channel = connection.create_channel
```

#### Declare exchange and queue and bind them

```ruby
exchange = Bunny::Exchange.new(
  channel,
  :topic,
  "first_topic_exchange"
)

queue = channel.queue(
  "handle_it",
  auto_delete: false,
  durable: true
)

queue.bind(exchange, "example.routing.key")
```

#### Publish messages to the exchange

```ruby
12.times do |i|
  exchange.publish(
    "hello-#{i}",
    routing_key: "example.routing.key",
    message_id:  "m-#{i}",
    timestamp:   Time.now.utc.to_i
  )
end
```

#### Open connection and create channel for consumer

```ruby
url = "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2F"

connection = Bunny.new(url)
connection.start

channel = connection.create_channel
```

#### Create consumer for queue

```ruby
queue = channel.queue("handle_it")
queue.bind(channel.exchange("first_topic_exchange", type: :topic), routing_key: "example.*.key")

consumer = Bunny::Consumer.new(
  channel,
  queue,
  channel.generate_consumer_tag,
  false, # no_ack == no automatic ack == manual ack
  false, # exclusive
  {}     # arguments
)
```

#### Subscribe consumer to queue

```ruby
consumer.on_delivery do |delivery_info, properties, payload|
  puts properties.timestamp     
  puts properties.message_id

  puts delivery_info.routing_key
  puts delivery_info.exchange    

  puts payload
end

queue.subscribe_with(consumer)
```

#### Take a break / close connection

```ruby
channel.basic_cancel(consumer_tag)
queue.subscribe_with(consumer)

channel.basic_cancel(consumer_tag)
channel.close
```

### Publishing messages with different guarantees (TODO)

* publisher confirmation
* persistence

### Consuming messages with different guarantees (TODO)

* ack
* prefetch_count

### Handling errors (TODO)

* delivery failure
* processing failure
* retries
* final failure

---

## Monitoring and Alerting

TODO:

* `rabbitmqctl list_queues` alert on queue length threshold
* use API to compare current queue setup with expected configuration

---

## Cluster setup

TODO:

* multipled nodes with low-maintenance / automatic synchronous replication
* high availability (HA) queues
* federated exchanges
* benefits
* drawbacks
* configuration options

---

## Best Practices

TODO:

* load JSON config file over API
* use one connection per process
* use one channel for each thread
* use separate connections for publish and consume
* reuse connections, keep connection:channel count low
* keep queues short, if not possible use lazy queues

---
